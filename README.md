PHP-PayPal-IPN
==============

__This code is over a decade old and no longer relevant. Please consult Paypal developer documentation instead.__

A PayPal Instant Payment Notification (IPN) class for PHP 5. 

Use the `IpnListener` class in your PHP IPN script to handle the encoding 
of POST data, post back to PayPal, and parsing of the response from PayPal.


Features
--------

* Switch between live and sandbox by setting the `use_sandbox` property.
* Supports both secure SSL and plain HTTP transactions by setting the `use_ssl`
  property (SSL is recommended).
* Supports both cURL and fsockopen network libraries by setting the `use_curl`
  property (cURL is recommended).
* Verifies an HTTP &quot;200&quot; response status code from the PayPal server.
* Get detailed plain text reports of the entire IPN using the `getTextReport()` 
  method for use in emails and logs to administrators.
* Throws various exceptions to differentiate between common errors in code or
  server configuration versus invalid IPN responses.


Getting Started
---------------

This code is intended for web developers. You should understand how the IPN
process works conceptually and you should understand when and why you would be
using IPN. Reading the [PayPal Instant Payment Notification Guide][1] is a good
place to start.

You should also have a [PayPal Sandbox Account][2] with a test buyer account and
a test seller account. When logged into your sandbox account there is an IPN
simulator under the 'Test Tools' menu which you can used to test your IPN 
listener.

Once you have your sandbox account setup, you simply create a PHP script that
will be your IPN listener. In that script, use the `IpnListener()` class as shown
below. For a more thoroughly documented example, take a look at the 
`example/ipn.php` script in the source code.

    <?php

    include('ipnlistener.php');

    $listener = new IpnListener();
    $listener->use_sandbox = true;

    try {
        $verified = $listener->processIpn();
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        // fatal error trying to process IPN.
        exit(0);
    }

    if ($verified) {
        // IPN response was "VERIFIED"
    } else {
        // IPN response was "INVALID"
    }

    ?>


Documentation
-------------

Documentation has not been generated yet, but, there are phpDocumentor style
docstrings (comments) throughout `ipnlistener.php` which explain the important
public properties and methods.

I have also written a more in-depth IPN tutorial on my blog: [PayPal IPN with PHP][3]

Known Issues
------------

__Problem__

The `processIpn()` method throws the following exception:

    cURL error: [52] GnuTLS recv error (-9): A TLS packet with unexpected length was received.

__Solution__

When cURL is compiled with GnuTLS the call to PayPal will fail if the SSL version
is not explicitly set as a cURL option. Set the `force_ssl_v3` property to force 
SSL 3:

    $listener = new IpnListener();
    $listener->force_ssl_v3 = true;

_Note: force_ssl_v3 is now true by default_



__Problem__

     PHP Warning: curl_setopt() [function.curl-setopt]: CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION 
     cannot be activated when in safe_mode or an open_basedir is set in ...

__Solution__

If you need PHP safe mode, you can disable CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION using the
`follow_location` property.

    $listener = new IpnListener();
    $listener->follow_location = false;

_Note: follow_location is now false enabled by default_


Example Report
--------------

Here is an example of a report returned by the `getTextReport()` method. Create
your own reports by extending the `IpnListener()` class or by accessing the data
directly in your ipn script.
